To support selective packet dropping at the mbox, I add a patch to the original ns-3 (version 3.21) source code. Specifically, I added an public interface named 'void SetEarlyDrop(bool flag)' for point-to-point-net-device. When a device call this interface with a True flag, it will drop the current packet. Further, the function also hooks up the trace. 

Please replace these two files when running the simulation code. These files are located in 'src/point-to-point/model' of ns-3.21.
