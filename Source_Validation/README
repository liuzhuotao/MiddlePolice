These source files are used for source validation. For more detail, please refer to section 6 in the paper for more details

To start the verifier, run sudo python server.py YOUR_SERVER_IP. You can host the server on either localhost or any publicly accessible IPs.

Then the server is accessible by http://YOUR_SERVER_IP on browser.

We do provide a client script (request.py) to connect to the server. It is possible to specify the source address in the script. If the source address is correct, the script will print 'Your source address has been verified!'. Otherwise, it will print the source address is not correct.
